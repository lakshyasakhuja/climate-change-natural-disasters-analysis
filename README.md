# The Influence of Climate Change on the Frequency and Severity of Natural Disasters

This repository contains my **DATA1001 (Foundations of Data Science)** project from the **University of Sydney (Semester 1)**, created using **R and Quarto**.

This was my **first data science research project**, focused on analysing how climate change contributes to the **increasing frequency, intensity, and impact of natural disasters** worldwide. The project emphasises evidence-based reasoning, structured analysis, and clear scientific communication.

## 📘 Project Overview

At a high level, this project examines how **human-driven climate change** is reshaping global disaster patterns. Rather than focusing on a single event or region, the analysis takes a **global and long-term perspective**, synthesising findings from climate science and international research bodies.

The project explores:

- Rising global temperatures and their relationship with extreme weather events  
- Trends in floods, cyclones, droughts, and wildfires  
- Scientific reasoning supported by IPCC-aligned findings  
- Environmental, social, and economic consequences of climate-driven disasters  
- The growing need for climate adaptation and resilience strategies  

---

## 🌍 Research Focus & Motivation

Climate change acts as a **risk multiplier**, increasing both the likelihood and severity of natural disasters. This project was motivated by the need to understand:

- Why extreme weather events are becoming more frequent  
- How climate variables such as temperature rise and greenhouse gas emissions amplify disaster severity  
- What these trends mean for ecosystems, infrastructure, economies, and vulnerable communities  

By connecting climate variables to real-world impacts, the project highlights the urgency of informed environmental decision-making.

## 📊 Analytical Approach

This project focuses on **foundational data science skills**, prioritising reasoning and interpretation over complex modelling. Key aspects include:

- Interpreting climate data and scientific reports  
- Identifying patterns and correlations in long-term environmental trends  
- Evaluating evidence from peer-reviewed literature and international organisations  
- Translating technical findings into clear, structured written analysis  

The emphasis is on **data-driven reasoning and communication**, aligning with the core learning objectives of DATA1001.

## 🧾 Report Production Workflow

The analysis was developed using **Quarto (`.qmd`) in R**, enabling a reproducible and professional workflow:

- A single **Quarto source file (`.qmd`)** contains the full analysis and narrative  
- The source file is rendered into:
  - **HTML** for web-based viewing  
  - **PDF** for formal academic submission  

This workflow demonstrates:
- Reproducible research practices  
- Clean separation between source content and output formats  
- Professional academic reporting standards  

All formats are included in this repository.
